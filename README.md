# tip_calculator_in_python
# Project Overview

This project is a simple Python-based Tip Calculator that helps calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a tip.

The program asks the user to enter the total bill amount, the tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the bill.

After processing the inputs, it calculates the final amount per person and displays the result.

This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts, user input handling, arithmetic operations, and rounding values.

# What Is Happening in This Project?

The program prompts the user to enter:
  * The total bill amount
  * The tip percentage
  * The number of people to split the bill

The total bill is increased based on the selected tip percentage.

The updated bill amount is then divided by the number of people.

The final amount per person is rounded to two decimal places and printed to the console.

Each time the program runs, different results are produced depending on the user’s inputs.

# Theories & Concepts Used

  * User Input (input())
  * Type Conversion (int(), float())
  * Arithmetic Operations
  * Rounding Numbers (round())
  * Variables
  * Sequential Program Flow
